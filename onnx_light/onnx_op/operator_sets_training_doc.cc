Gradient operator computes the partial derivatives of a specific tensor w.r.t.
some other tensors. This operator is widely used in gradient-based training
algorithms. To illustrate its use, let's consider a computation graph,

```
X -----.
       |
       v
W --> Conv --> H --> Gemm --> Y
                      ^
                      |
                      Z
```

, where W and Z are trainable tensors. Note that operators' attributes are
omitted for the sake of simplicity. Let dY/dW (dY/dZ) be the gradient of
Y with respect to W (Z). The user can compute gradient by inserting Gradient
operator to form another graph shown below.

```
W --> Conv --> H --> Gemm --> Y
|      ^              ^
|      |              |
|      X              Z
|      |              |
|      |   .----------'
|      |   |  (W/Z/X is the 1st/2nd/3rd input of Gradient as shown in
|      |   |   "xs" followed by "zs")
|      v   v
'---> Gradient(xs=["W", "Z"], zs=["X"], y="Y")
       |   |
       |   '-----------------------------------> dY/dW (1st output of Gradient)
       |
       '---------------------------------------> dY/dZ (2nd output of Gradient)
```

By definition, the tensor "y" is a function of independent variables in "xs"
and "zs". Since we only compute the gradient of "y" w.r.t. the differentiable
variables in "xs", this Gradient only outputs dY/dW and dY/dZ. Note that "H"
cannot appear in "xs" and "zs". The reason is that "H" can be determined by
tensors "W" and "X" and therefore "H" is not an independent variable.

All outputs are optional. If needed, for example, user can assign an empty
string to the 1st output name of that Gradient to skip the generation of dY/dW.
Note that the concept of optional outputs can also be found in ONNX's RNN, GRU,
and LSTM.

Gradient operator can compute derivative against intermediate tensors. For
example, the gradient of Y with respect to H can be done via

```
W --> Conv --> H --> Gemm --> Y
       ^       |      ^
       |       |      |
       X       |      Z
       .-------'      |
       |   .----------'
       |   | (H/Z is the 1st/2nd input of Gradient as shown in "xs")
       v   v
      Gradient(xs=["H", "Z"], y="Y")
       |   |
       |   '-----------------------------------> dY/dH (1st output of Gradient)
       |
       '---------------------------------------> dY/dZ (2nd output of Gradient)
```

It is possible to represent high-order differentiation using Gradient operators.
For example, given the following linear model:

```
W --> Gemm --> Y --> Loss --> O
       ^              ^
       |              |
       X              L
```

To compute the 2nd order derivative of O with respect to W (denoted by
d^2O/dW^2), one can do

```
W --> Gemm --> Y --> Loss --> O
|      ^              ^
|      |              |
|      X .------------L
|      | |            |
|      | |            v
+------+-+> Gradient(xs=["X", "W"], zs=["L"], y="O") ---> dO/dX (1st output of Gradient)
|      | |    |
|      | |    '---> dO/dW (2nd output of Gradient)
|      v v
'---> Gradient(xs=["X", "W"], zs=["L"], y="dO/dW") ---> d(dO/dW)dX (1st output of
       |                                                  Gradient)
       |
       |
       '---> d^2O/dW^2 (2nd output of Gradient)
```

The tensors named in attributes "xs", "zs", and "y" define the differentiated
computation graph, and the inputs to Gradient node define the values at
which the gradient is computed. We can feed different tensors to the identified
graph. For example, one can compute the gradient of Y with respect to H at
a specific value of H, H_1, by providing that value as an input to the Gradient
node.

```
W --> Conv --> H --> Gemm --> Y
       ^              ^
       |              |
       X              Z

          Z_1 (2nd input of Gradient)
           |
           v
H_1 --> Gradient(xs=["H", "Z"], y="Y") ---> dY/dH when H = H_1 and Y = Y_1.
           |
           '------------------------------> dY/dZ (2nd output of Gradient)
```

When the inputs of Gradient are the tensors named in "xs" and "zs", the
computation can be optimized. More specifically, intermediate variables in
forward pass can be reused if the gradient is computed via reverse-mode
auto-differentiation.

std::string MakeAdamDoc() {
  return R"DOC(
    Compute one iteration of Adam, a stochastic gradient based optimization
    algorithm. This operator can conduct the optimization of multiple tensor variables.

    Let's define the behavior of this operator. First of all, Adam requires
    some parameters:

     - The learning-rate "R".
     - The update count "T". That is, the number of training iterations conducted.
     - A L2-norm regularization coefficient "norm_coefficient".
     - A small constant "epsilon" to avoid dividing-by-zero.
     - Two coefficients, "alpha" and "beta".

    At each Adam iteration, the optimized tensors are moved along a direction
    computed based on their exponentially-averaged historical gradient and
    exponentially-averaged historical squared gradient. Assume that only a tensor
    "X" is being optimized. The rest of required information is

     - the value of "X",
     - "X"'s gradient (denoted by "G"),
     - "X"'s exponentially-averaged historical gradient (denoted by "V"), and
     - "X"'s exponentially-averaged historical squared gradient (denoted by "H").

    Some of those parameters are passed into this operator as input tensors and others
    are stored as this operator's attributes. Specifically, this operator's input tensor
    list is ["R", "T", "X", "G", "V", "H"]. That is, "R" is the first input, "T" is
    the second input, and so on. Other parameters are given as attributes because they
    are constants. Moreover, the corresponding output tensors are

     - the new value of "X" (called "X_new"),
     - the new exponentially-averaged historical gradient (denoted by "V_new"), and
     - the new exponentially-averaged historical squared gradient (denoted by "H_new").

    Those outputs are computed following the pseudo code below.

    Let "+", "-", "*", and "/" are all element-wise arithmetic operations with
    numpy-style broadcasting support. The pseudo code to compute those outputs is:

      // Add gradient of 0.5 * norm_coefficient * ||X||_2^2, where ||X||_2 is the 2-norm.
      G_regularized = norm_coefficient * X + G

      // Update exponentially-averaged historical gradient.
      V_new = alpha * V + (1 - alpha) * G_regularized

      // Update exponentially-averaged historical squared gradient.
      H_new = beta * H + (1 - beta) * G_regularized * G_regularized

      // Compute the element-wise square-root of H_new. V_new will be element-wisely
      // divided by H_sqrt for a better update direction.
      H_sqrt = Sqrt(H_new) + epsilon

      // Compute learning-rate. Note that "alpha**T"/"beta**T" is alpha's/beta's T-th power.
      R_adjusted = T > 0 ? R * Sqrt(1 - beta**T) / (1 - alpha**T) : R

      // Compute new value of "X".
      X_new = X - R_adjusted * V_new / H_sqrt

      // Post-update regularization.
      X_final = (1 - norm_coefficient_post) * X_new

    If there are multiple inputs to be optimized, the pseudo code will be applied
    independently to each of them.
